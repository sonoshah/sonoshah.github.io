intro:
  title: Hello!
  body: >
    My name is Sono Shah. I am a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at the [University of California Riverside](http://politicalscience.ucr.edu/). I also work as a researcher with [AAPI Data](www.aapidata.com), where we make data on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders more accessible.
    Iâ€™m interested in race & ethnicity, political participation, and civic engagement in the U.S. 

   
    My dissertation focuses on Asian Americans and Latinos and their campaign contribution behavior where I use administrative records from the FEC as well as survey data from the National Asian American Survey.


    > As part of my work at AAPI Data, I also create tools to increase the accessibility of demographic data, my most recent project was to create a Community Factsheet tool using shiny, check it out [here](http://facts.aapidata.com/). <img src="img/aapidata_facts.gif" style = "display: block; width:350px; min-width: 300px max; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-top:30px;">
