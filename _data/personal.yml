intro:
  title: Hello!
  body: >
    My name is Sono Shah. I am a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at the [University of California Riverside](http://politicalscience.ucr.edu/). 
    Iâ€™m interested in race & ethnicity and political and civic engagement in the U.S. 

    My dissertation focuses on Asian Americans and Latinos and their campaign contribution behavior.

    I also work as a researcher with [AAPI Data](www.aapidata.com) where we make data on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders more accessible.
