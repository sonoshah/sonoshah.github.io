intro:
  title: Hello!
  body: >
    My name is Sono Shah. I am a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at the [University of California Riverside](http://politicalscience.ucr.edu/). I also work as a researcher with [AAPI Data](www.aapidata.com), where we make data on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders more accessible.
    Iâ€™m interested in race & ethnicity, political participation, and civic engagement in the U.S. 

   
    My dissertation focuses on Asian Americans and Latinos and their campaign contribution behavior where I use administrative records from the FEC as well as survey data from the National Asian American Survey.
