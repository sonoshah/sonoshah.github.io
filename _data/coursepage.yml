  title: "POSC 149: Presidential Elections" 
  body: >
   Welcome to my course page for Presidential Elections. One of my major goals for this class, was for my students to get some exposure to working with real data.
   I designed this course to allow for a large amount of hands-on activities. Students work with multiple datasets using Hadley Wickam's excellent [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) package in R.
   Some of the planned labs include: working with county-level election returns, scraping twitter for sentiment analysis, and exploring the 2016 CCES.
